# Java-Tic-Tac-Toe
Here's my repo containing code about my Java's tictactoe game

# How to Play it
1. Copy the link of this repo and clone it somewhere in your computer
2. Go into the src folder, then open terminal from there
3. Make sure that you are already installed Java in your computer
4. Run this code
 ```
 javac TicTacToe.java
 java TicTacToe
 ```
 
 After that, you can play the game!
 Note that the game only can be played once everytime it runned. I still hasn't add the retry feature in this game.
